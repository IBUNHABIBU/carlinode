2. Upload image in local was working but not in production

it causes the error undefined cars for nil class

Solution
I removed the association btn user model and car model
so instead of @car = current_user.cars.build(car_params)  I used @car = Car.new(car_params)

3. Another cause of blocked by cors

setting enviroment variables in heroku I used heroku config:set RAILS_MASTER_KEY = 'cat config/master.key' insead of using the backticks ``
